      <description>The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) is a formative assessment designed to provide you with information about key college skills. DAACS includes assessments in self-regulated learning, mathematics, reading, and writing. YOU ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING ASSESSMENT. This should take about 10 minutes to complete the assessment and there is no passing or failing. Once you are done, I encourage you to review the resources recommended to you.</description>

      <description>The solutions to the practice problems are at the end of the book and do not need to be handed in. Graded assignments should use the provided R markdown templates provided below. Data for the homework assignments, and for within the chapters too, can be downloaded here. Or alternatively all the data is included in the openintro R packge (use the data(package = &#39;openintro&#39;) command to list all the datasets available in that package).</description>
